First order all-pass filter (fo_apf)

First order high-pass filter (fo_hpf)

First order low-pass filter (fo_lpf)

All the filters are now header files and they are located in the lib/ folder. In order to use them just copy the lib/ folder (and rename it if needed) into your project folder. There's an example how to build later in the README.
